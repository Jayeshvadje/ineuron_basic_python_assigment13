# Question 5:
# Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# hello world! 123
# Then, the output should be:
# LETTERS 10
# DIGITS 3

a = input("Type the letter ")
l =  0
d =  0
for i in a:
    if i.isalpha():
        l = l + 1
    if i.isdigit():
        d = d + 1
    else:
        pass

print("Letters:", l)
print("Digits:", d)
