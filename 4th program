# Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints
# the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
# Then, the output should be:
# again and hello makes perfect practice world

a=input("enter the words\n")
a=a.split(' ')

        if i not in duplicates:
            duplicates.append(i)
        else:
            continue

duplicates.sort()
