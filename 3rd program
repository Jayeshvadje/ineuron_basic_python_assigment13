# Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the
# words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# without,hello,bag,world
# Then, the output should be:
# bag,hello,without,world

#take a input from user
a=str(input("enter the words you want\n"))
try:
    a=a.split(",")
    print("words you gave", a)
    #use sort for sorting the words by alphabetical order
    a.sort()
    #print the words
    print(','.join(a))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
